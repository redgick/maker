## The birth of an idea

A few years ago, [Jordi Parra](http://zenona.com/about/) presented his
idea of the [**Spotify Box**](http://zenona.com/work/spotify-box/).

During the summer 2015, [Sébastien Barbier](https://sebastienbarbier.com/)
presented me the project and ask me
[to draft a first implementation](https://mpd-box.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
with him. We came up with the [mpd-box](https://github.com/mpd-box/mpd-box/)
and organized a great karaoke session based on its features.

In the meantime, in August 2016
[Lunii](http://zenona.com/work/spotify-box/) launched a box:
[My Fabulous Storyteller](https://www.lunii.fr/en/) that was offered
to one of my collegue children.

When I saw how friendly, fun, and playful it was, I had no stop to
wish working on that project again. The Hackaton organized at the IMT
Atlantique Incubator in Rennes this fall was a great opportunity to
scratch that itch again.

The idea is to create a new way to interact with your music. Once
setup, just grab a tag and start listening to it without having to
navigate a screen interface. Remove it, and it will stop.

This can be useful for when you cannot touch a screen because of wet
or dirty hands (cooking, plowing, taking a shower or fixing you car).

It can be useful also to prevent children using a screen just before
going to sleep or for blind or short-sighted people to play music
easily.


## The Hardware we used to build the prototype

We needed three parts:

- A small computer able to read the music files in some speaker
- A small NFC reader able to detect new tags and their removal
- USB powered speakers

For the former we used a Raspberry Pi 3 with Raspbian installed on it
and a little Python script listening to the serial port.

For the later we used an arduino with an AdaFruit PN532 NFC/RFID
Controller Shield for the Arduino Uno.

In the MPD-Box project Sébastian used directly a Rasberry Explore NFC
Board. In our case we had NFC card reader boards for Arduino and we
wanted something modular so that we could reuse the NFC reader for
other kind of projects.

Using USB powered speakers let you have only one power cable to power
the Raspberry Pi and then plug both the speakers and the Arduino via
USB.

## Software stack

### Configure the Raspberry Pi Wifi and SSH access

To configure the Raspberry Pi, I plugged a HDMI screen and a USB keyboard.

I installed Raspbian on the SDCard and then started the computer.

The default user is ``pi`` and the password is ``raspberry``.

The protip is to type the password in the username field to make sure
you type it correctly (especially with an azerty keyboard) and then use
ctrl+U to cut it, enter the ``pi`` username, press enter and then use
ctrl+Y to paste the password and then press enter to validate it.

#### Configure wifi

Add the credentials for your wifi in the ```wpa_supplicant``` config file:

```bash
$ sudo su  # To grab root access
# wpa_passphrase "SSID" "WifiPassword" >> /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
# service networking restart
```

You can get your IP address by using:

```
$ ifconfig | egrep 'inet '
        inet 127.0.0.1  netmask 255.0.0.0
        inet 192.168.43.179  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.43.255
```

Here my IP address is ``192.168.43.179``

#### Configure SSH daemon

```bash
# update-rc.d ssh defaults
# update-rc.d ssh enable
```

### Give access to the /var/lib/mpd/music repository to ``pi``

```bash
# chown -R mpd:audio /var/lib/mpd/music
# chmod g+ws -R /var/lib/mpd/music
```

You can know use FileZilla to upload some files in the
``/var/lib/mpd/music`` repository using the pi user.

```bash
scp music.mp3 pi@192.168.43.179:/var/lib/mpd/music/
```

### Music Player daemon
To store playlists and play them we decided to use Music Player Daemon.

It has multiple benefits:

- It is well integrated with Raspbian
- It starts automatically as a daemon at startup
- It know how to play various kinds of files and URLs
- It can be remotely controlled and managed through the wifi
  connection of the Raspberry.

Each tag ID is unique and we decided to use them as MPD playlist
names.

#### How to install MPD on the Raspberry Pi

```
sudo apt install mpd
```

#### How to configure MPD?

- Put all the music you want on the SDCARD in the MPD Music folder
- You the network and Sonata to configure the playlist you want.
- Name the playlist with the tag ID

### Tag reader code on the Arduino

The last version of the Tag reader code can be found on
[the dedicated Github repository](https://github.com/MusicBoxProject/NFC-reader)

- At startup you initialize the Serial port and the PN532 board

```c
// Adafruit lib to drive the NFC Shield
#include <Adafruit_PN532.h>

// If using the breakout or shield with I2C, define just the pins connected
// to the IRQ and reset lines.  Use the values below (2, 3) for the shield!
#define PN532_IRQ   (2)
#define PN532_RESET (3)  // Not connected by default on the NFC Shield

// Or use this line for a breakout or shield with an I2C connection:
Adafruit_PN532 nfc(PN532_IRQ, PN532_RESET);

int inByte = 0; // incoming serial byte

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:

  Serial.begin(115200);

  // NFC reader initialization
  nfc.begin();

  uint32_t versiondata = nfc.getFirmwareVersion();
  if (! versiondata) {
    Serial.print("Didn't find PN53x board");
    while (1); // halt
  }
  // Got ok data, print it out!
  Serial.print("Found chip PN5"); Serial.println((versiondata >> 24) & 0xFF, HEX);
  Serial.print("Firmware ver. "); Serial.print((versiondata >> 16) & 0xFF, DEC);
  Serial.print('.'); Serial.println((versiondata >> 8) & 0xFF, DEC);

  // configure board to read RFID tags
  nfc.SAMConfig();
}
```

- In the loop, you can periodically read the NFC tag with a timeout to
  detect case where the tag has been removed from the reader.

```c
#define TIMEOUT 100
uint8_t currentUid[] = { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 };  // Buffer to store the current UID

void loop() {
  uint8_t success;
  uint8_t uid[] = { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 };  // Buffer to store the returned UID
  uint8_t uidLength;                        // Length of the UID (4 or 7 bytes depending on ISO14443A card type)

  // Wait for an ISO14443A type cards (Mifare, etc.).  When one is found
  // 'uid' will be populated with the UID, and uidLength will indicate
  // if the uid is 4 bytes (Mifare Classic) or 7 bytes (Mifare Ultralight)
  success = nfc.readPassiveTargetID(PN532_MIFARE_ISO14443A, uid, &uidLength, TIMEOUT);


  if (!compare(uid, currentUid)) {
    printTag(uid);
    copy(uid, currentUid);
  }
}

bool compare(uint8_t * uid1, uint8_t * uid2) {
  for (int i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
    if (uid1[i] != uid2[i]) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}

void copy(uint8_t * uidSource, uint8_t * uidTarget) {
  for (int i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
    uidTarget[i] = uidSource[i];
  }
}

void printTag(uint8_t * uid) {
  for (int i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
    Serial.print(uid[i], HEX);
  }
  Serial.print("\n");
}
```

- It will send the tag ID when a new tag is put on top of the reader
- It will send 0000000 when the tag is removed
- It will send `TIMEOUT!` when nothing can be read.


### Serial daemon on the Raspberry Pi

Then we use a Python script in the Raspberry Pi that will read the
Serial port and send command to MPD with regards to the tag info.

The [last version of the code](https://github.com/MusicBoxProject/raspberry-service/blob/master/serial/daemon.py) can be found on Github:


```python
import re
from serial import Serial
from mpd import MPDClient

SERIAL_PORT = "/dev/ttyACM0"
BAUDRATE = 115200
MPD_HOST = "localhost"
MPD_PORT = 6600

IS_TAG = re.compile("^[0-9A-F]+$")  # Detect if what we read is a valid tag ID.

client = MPDClient()

with Serial(port=SERIAL_PORT, baudrate=BAUDRATE, timeout=1, writeTimeout=1) as serial_port:
    if serial_port.isOpen():
        previous_line = None
        while True:
            line = serial_port.readline()
            line = line.decode().strip()
            if not IS_TAG.match(line):
                continue

            if line == '0000000':
                action = "stop"
            else:
                action = "play"

            if action is not None:
                try:
                    client.connect(MPD_HOST, MPD_PORT)
                    if action == "stop" and previous_line:
                        print("Stopping", previous_line)
                        client.stop()
                        previous_line = None
                    elif action == "play":
                        print("Starting", line)
                        client.clear()
                        client.load(str(line))
                        client.play(0)
                        previous_line = line
                except Exception as e:
                    print('Error', e)
                finally:
                    client.close()
                    client.disconnect()
```

- The script needs two dependencies: ``sudo pip install pyserial python-mpd2``
- To start the script at startup you can add this line at the end of ``/etc/rc.local``:

```bash
python /home/pi/raspberry-service/serial/daemon.py > /var/log/serial.log &
```

### Conclusion

You can now plug the Raspberry Pi and once Raspbian started you can
play the music automatically by selecting the tag.

You can use Sonata on 192.168.43.179:6600 to manage your playlist.

You can look at the tag ID by looking in ``/var/log/serial.log``
